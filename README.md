**Comprehensive quantitative research validating the low volatility anomaly across 360 S&P stocks (2002-2021)**

**Key Findings:**
- **Anomaly confirmed** in 60% of time periods analyzed (3 of 5 subsets)
- **Optimal portfolio** identified in mid-volatility range (Portfolio 5: 1.05% returns, 1.07 beta)
- **High-beta underperformance**: Portfolio 10 (highest vol/beta) consistently delivered lowest returns
- **CAPM breakdown**: Traditional risk-return relationship failed in majority of periods

**Research Methodology:**
- **360-stock universe** sorted into 10 decile portfolios (36 stocks each)
- **Multi-period validation** across 5-year subsets (2002-2006, 2007-2011, 2012-2016, 2017-2021)
- **Comprehensive risk metrics**: Beta calculations via OLS regression, portfolio variance using covariance matrices
- **Sector analysis**: Individual stock examples (AMD β=2.37, Southern Company β=0.23)

**Investment Implications:**
- **Behavioral explanations**: Investor biases toward "lottery" stocks, institutional constraints
- **Risk management**: Volatility drag effects on compounded returns
- **Portfolio construction**: Evidence against high-beta strategies, support for defensive positioning
