### Fama-French Factor Analysis
- Applied 3- and 5-Factor models in R and Excel to forecast global mutual fund returns
- Computed and visualized factor loadings, alpha, and t-statistics using robust OLS regression
- Presented equity curves and correlation heatmaps across market-neutral portfolios.

### [Low Volatility Anomaly Study](./Low_Volatility_Anomaly_Analysis.html)
**Comprehensive quantitative research validating the low volatility anomaly across 360 S&P stocks (2002-2021)**

**Key Findings:**
- **Anomaly confirmed** in 60% of time periods analyzed (3 of 5 subsets)
- **Optimal portfolio** identified in mid-volatility range (Portfolio 5: 1.05% returns, 1.07 beta)
- **High-beta underperformance**: Portfolio 10 (highest vol/beta) consistently delivered lowest returns
- **CAPM breakdown**: Traditional risk-return relationship failed in majority of periods

**Research Methodology:**
- **360-stock universe** sorted into 10 decile portfolios (36 stocks each)
- **Multi-period validation** across 5-year subsets (2002-2006, 2007-2011, 2012-2016, 2017-2021)
- **Comprehensive risk metrics**: Beta calculations via OLS regression, portfolio variance using covariance matrices
- **Sector analysis**: Individual stock examples (AMD β=2.37, Southern Company β=0.23)

**Investment Implications:**
- **Behavioral explanations**: Investor biases toward "lottery" stocks, institutional constraints
- **Risk management**: Volatility drag effects on compounded returns
- **Portfolio construction**: Evidence against high-beta strategies, support for defensive positioning

### [Asian vs European Option Pricing](./Asian_vs_European_Option_Pricing(1).html)

This project compares the pricing of Asian and European call and put options using a combination of Monte Carlo simulation and the Black-Scholes-Merton analytical model. It highlights the effects of path dependence and averaging on option valuation.

**Overview:**

- **European options** are priced using the Black-Scholes-Merton formula.
- **Asian options** (arithmetic average) are priced via Monte Carlo simulation.
- The simulation explores both standard geometric Brownian motion and jump diffusion dynamics.

**Contents:**

- Simulation of GBM and jump-diffusion asset paths
- Black-Scholes functions for analytical option pricing
- Monte Carlo simulation for Asian call and put options
- Pricing comparison across strike prices
- Visualization and interpretation of results

**Key Insights:**

- Asian options are consistently less expensive than European options due to volatility averaging.
- The gap between Asian and European prices widens for deep in-the-money and out-of-the-money strikes.
- Path-dependent options like Asians exhibit reduced convexity and differ from traditional put-call parity.
